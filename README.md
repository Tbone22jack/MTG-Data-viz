# MTG-Data-viz
This is a fairly basic analysis of cards in Magic the Gathering. I am using data supplied by MTGJSON. This data set is quite large and information rich beacasue the game has been around for so long. Most of the analytics found in here are just curiosities of mine. The goal of this project is to present some graphics that some may find intresting.
